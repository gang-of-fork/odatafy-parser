# odatafy

odatafy is a framework that is designed to help developers with creating better REST-API, by implementing a subset (consisting the most important operations) from the official [oData Specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part2-url-conventions.html#sec_Introduction).

To achieve this odatafy provides an ecosystem of adapter packages that each leverage the odatafy parser to map odata requests to databases. The goal of odatafy is to provide oData compatible API-standards, to help developers accelarting REST-API development. Therefore odatafy implements only subset of operations
